1. Mix each ingredient into dough.
2. Divide the dough into two pieces. Smaller sections of dough are easier to roll out.
3. Roll out the cookie dough. Roll it out to a 1/4 inch thick or just under that. If you have difficulty evenly rolling out dough, try an adjustable rolling pin.
4. Chill the rolled out cookie dough. Without chilling, these cookie cutter sugar cookies won't hold their shape. Chill the rolled out cookie dough for at least one to two hours and up to two days.
5. Cut the dough into shapes.
6. Bake the dough and let it cool. Depending on size, the cookies take about ten to twelve minutes.
7. Decorate.

Have a little flour nearby when youâ€™re rolling out the cookie dough. Keep your work surface, hands, and rolling pin lightly floured. This is a relatively soft dough.
